Article On Web Request Journey
Have you ever wondered what really happens when you type "https://www.google.com" into your web browser and press Enter? The journey from typing a web address to actually seeing a web page is quite interesting. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at how different parts of the internet work together to make this happen and get a better understanding of how the internet works.
So, when you type something like "www.google.com" in your browser and hit Enter, your browser starts a process to find the computer where the website is located. This process begins with something called DNS (Domain Name System), which is like a map that helps your browser find the right address connected to the web address you typed.
All the data that moves around the internet follows certain rules known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). These rules make sure that your browser can talk to the right computer and send and receive information properly. It's like the internet's communication rulebook.
As your request travels, it might bump into something called a firewall. Think of it as an internet security guard that decides what information can go through and what should be stopped. This is important to keep your internet safe from potential threats.
When you see "https://" at the start of a web address, it means you have a secure connection. This is where HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) come into play. They create a safe way for information to travel, making sure it's all private and protected.
Websites often have lots of computers working together. Load balancers are like traffic directors, making sure all the incoming web users are evenly spread across these computers. This helps websites work smoothly, even when lots of people visit at the same time.
The journey continues as your request reaches the web server. This computer processes your request and puts together web pages with text, pictures, and things you can click on. It's like the web page factory that makes the content you asked for.
For websites that change or show personalized things, the application server is the star. It takes care of your request, talks to databases, and creates content that's just right for you. The application server is like the middle person between you and the database, making sure you get the latest information.
Databases are like digital libraries where websites keep and get data. They are like storage places where the application server goes to find the information you want. This is the last piece of the puzzle that helps you see what you want on your web page.
To wrap it up, the journey of a web request, from finding the right address to talking to the database, is a perfect example of how many different parts need to work together for web browsing to be smooth. There are a lot of things that make the internet work, and each part plays its own role.
