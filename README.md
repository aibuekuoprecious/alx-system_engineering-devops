# System Engineering DevOps Repository

Welcome to the System Engineering DevOps repository! üåê‚öôÔ∏è Here, I've curated my exploration of various languages and tools crucial to system engineering and DevOps practices, acquired during the ALX Software Engineering program.

## Language and Tool Breakdown:

- **Shell (56.7%):** Delve into Shell scripting, the backbone of system engineering and automation. Explore my scripts that streamline processes, automate tasks, and enhance system administration efficiency.

- **Python (26.5%):** Discover my implementation of Python in the realm of system engineering and DevOps. From scripting to building automation tools, Python showcases its versatility in managing and orchestrating complex systems.

- **Puppet (11.3%):** Explore my work with Puppet, a powerful configuration management tool. Dive into manifests and modules that illustrate my skills in automating and maintaining consistent configurations across multiple systems.

- **Ruby (3.2%):** Learn about my usage of Ruby, particularly in the context of DevOps. Ruby scripts and tools contribute to the automation and deployment pipelines, showcasing the flexibility and power of this language.

- **C (1.4%):** Delve into C programming in the context of system-level development. Though a small percentage, C plays a crucial role in certain performance-critical aspects of system engineering.

- **Dockerfile (0.6%):** Explore Dockerfile examples that demonstrate my proficiency in containerization. Docker plays a pivotal role in creating lightweight, portable, and scalable environments for applications.

- **HTML (0.3%):** Discover how HTML fits into the world of system engineering and DevOps. While a small percentage, understanding HTML is valuable for creating documentation and web interfaces in these domains.

## Why Explore This Repository:
